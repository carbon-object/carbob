# carbon object tokens

Carbon neutrality means balancing emitting carbon and absorbing carbon from the atmosphere in carbon sinks.
The carbon object tokens will help track and prove the carbon neutrality of individuals and businesses.

The idea is to use a public blockchain platform (Ethereum?, solana? ...) to build a record of polluters and the efforts they take to offset their emissions.

Inspired by famous play-to-earn nft games like [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/) which allows players to collect, breed, raise, battle, and trade token-based creatures known as Axies.

Carbon object allows "players" to collect and hold token-based objects known as Carbon Objects (CAOB).

These CAOBs can take various forms, some of them are polluting objects releasing carbon, and some are carbon sink objects. 

To avoid market speculation: make CARBOB_SINK an NFT with an expiration date. CARBOB_SINK NFTs need to be neutralized within a time period otherwise they get burned. Also the NFT will have a reference to the CARBOB_SINK producer so that the CARBOB_NEUTRAL token that includes the token has knowledge of who has offset the carbon.

Each CAOB is a non-fungible token (NFT), sold on the Carbon Object marketplace and minted using the Carbon Object Token (CARBOB).

By holding these CAOBs in a visible public account, the holder demonstrates a) the pollution that she is producing and b) the efforts she is taken to offset them.

### a) the pollution produced

Similar to defi staking (see e.g., https://stake.axieinfinity.com/), holders of CAOBs are receiving daily 
"rewards" in the form of CARBOB_POLUTE tokens, which are getting added to their account. The more CARBOB_POLUTE tokens the holder
has, the more pollution is produced.

### b) the efforts to offset pollution

The holder can neutralize their holdings of CARBOB_POLUTE tokens.
The purchase of CARBOB_SINK tokens can do this. One CARBOB_SINK token offsets one CARBOB_POLUTE token, and 
the neutralization process creates a CARBOB_NEUTRAL token (i.e., proof of offset for the holder).

### CARBOB_SINK token creation

Holders that hold sink-CAOBs are rewarded with daily CARBOB_SINK tokens, which they can sell on the market. 
The issuance of sink-CAOBs needs to be carefully vetted by a central authority to ensure only
genuine projects get rewarded. 

The carbon object ecosystem also has its unique governance token, known as Carbon Object Token (CARBOB). 
These are used to participate in crucial governance votes and will give holders a say in how funds in the Treasury are spent.
